# Esbuild Starter for Enonic XP

This starter kit will set up an empty shell for your new Enonic app.

Once initiated, you'll have the bare minimum needed to create a new Enonic
application. You'll have all the folders set up, and can get
straight to creating what you're creating.


## Usage XP 7

You first need to install Enonic CLI. Then run the following commands to build and depoy it:

```bash
~ $ enonic project create
... Answer wizard question

~ $ cd <project-folder>
~/new-project $ enonic project deploy
```

Your brand new app should now be up and running on http://localhost:8080
